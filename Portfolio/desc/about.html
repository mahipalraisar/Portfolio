                        I am a passionate web developer currently pursuing my MCA. I have a keen interest in web development, especially using the MERN stack. My journey began with a fascination for technology and has grown into a deep commitment to creating impactful and user-friendly web applications.

                        Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I am particularly skilled in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express. My goal is to leverage these skills to build innovative solutions and continuously improve my craft.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                        When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in tech, or working on personal projects. I am always eager to learn and grow, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career.
